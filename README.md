# Axolotl is a crossplattform [Signal](https://www.signal.org) client

## For the Ubuntu Phone and more

Axolotl is a complete Signal client, it allows you to create a Signal account and have discussions with your contacts.
Unlike the desktop Signal client, **Axolotl is completely autonomous** and doesn't require you to have created an account with the official Signal application.

It is built upon the [Go textsecure package](https://github.com/nanu-c/textsecure/) and a vuejs app that runs in a electron/qml WebEngineView container.

To use it from your Ubuntu Touch device, simply install it from the open store:  
[![OpenStore](https://open-store.io/badges/en_US.png)](https://open-store.io/app/textsecure.nanuc)

Axolotl is also available as a snap package, to install it on Ubuntu desktop:

What works
-----------

 * Phone registration
 * Contact discovery
 * Direct messages
 * Group messages *mostly*
 * Photo, video, audio and contact attachments in both direct and group mode
 * Preview for photo and audio attachments
 * Storing conversations
 * Encrypted message store
 * Desktop client provisioning/syncing *partially*

What is missing
---------------

 * Push notifications
 * Most settings that are available in the Android app
 * Encrypted phone calls

There are still bugs and UI/UX quirks.

Installation of development environment
------------
* Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* Install node js (see the [.nvmrc](axolotl-web/.nvmrc)) file for the supported version
* Add gopath to ~/.bashrc https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH
* install dependencies `sudo apt install mercurial`
* Check out this git `go get -d github.com/nanu-c/axolotl`
* `cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/nanu-c/axolotl`
* get go dependencies `go mod download`
* install axolotl-web dependencies: `cd axolotl-web&&npm install`

Translations
------------

For information how to translate, please see [TRANSLATE.md](docs/TRANSLATE.md).

Run development
------------
* `cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/nanu-c/axolotl`
* `go run .`
* in a new terminal `cd axolotl-web&&npm run serve`
* point a browser to the link printed in the terminal  like `http://localhost:9080`

Run frontend and connect to phone ip
--------------
That way running the backend is avoided, instead your current registration on ubuntu touch is used
* `cd axolotl-web`
* `VUE_APP_WS_ADDRESS=10.0.0.2 npm run serve` replace 10.0.0.2 with the ip of your phone

Build Axolotl for all arches with clickable and snap
------------
This requires clickable and snapcraft to be installed
see [build.sh](scripts/build.sh)

Installation on UT
------------

***If you want to use the current stable version, simply install it from the OpenStore***

The build-system is now integrated in the `clickable` Version 3.2.0.
* primary steps from installation
* Get [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable#install)
* Run `clickable`, this also transfers the click package to the Ubuntu Touch Phone
* Run `clickable launch logs` to start signal and watch the log
